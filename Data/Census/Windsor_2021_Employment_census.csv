Notes:
1,"""Gender"" refers to an individual's personal and social identity as a man, woman or non-binary person (a person who is not exclusively a man or a woman)."
,"Gender includes the following concepts:"
,"* gender identity, which refers to the gender that a person feels internally and individually;"
,"* gender expression, which refers to the way a person presents their gender, regardless of their gender identity, through body language, aesthetic choices or accessories (e.g., clothes, hairstyle and makeup), which may have traditionally been associated with a specific gender."
,"A person's gender may differ from their sex at birth, and from what is indicated on their current identification or legal documents such as their birth certificate, passport or driver's licence. A person's gender may change over time."
,"Some people may not identify with a specific gender."
,"Given that the non-binary population is small, data aggregation to a two-category gender variable is sometimes necessary to protect the confidentiality of responses provided. In these cases, individuals in the category ""non-binary persons"" are distributed into the other two gender categories and are denoted by the ""+"" symbol."
2,"This category includes men (and/or boys), as well as some non-binary persons."
3,"This category includes women (and/or girls), as well as some non-binary persons."
150,"Refers to whether a person aged 15 years and over was employed, unemployed or not in the labour force during the week of Sunday, May 2 to Saturday, May 8, 2021."
,"For information on the comparability of the 2021 Census labour force status data with those of the Labour Force Survey, see Appendix 2.11 of the Dictionary, Census of Population, 2021."
151,"Refers to the number of weeks in which a person aged 15 years and over worked for pay or in self-employment in 2020 at all jobs held, even if only for a few hours, and whether these weeks were mostly full time (30 hours or more per week) or mostly part time (less than 30 hours per week)."

153,"Includes persons aged 15 years and over who worked full year (49 weeks and over) and mostly full time (30 hours or more per week) in 2020."
154,"Includes persons aged 15 years and over who worked full year mostly part time or part year either mostly full time or mostly part time in 2020. Part year is less than 49 weeks and part time is less than 30 hours per week."
155,"Class of worker including job permanency refers to whether a person is a paid employee or is self-employed. Employees' positions are further classified as either permanent or temporary."
156,"Includes unemployed persons aged 15 years and over who have never worked for pay or in self-employment, or who had last worked prior to January 1, 2020."
157,"Includes persons aged 15 years and over in the labour force who have worked at some point in time between January 1, 2020 and May 8, 2021."
158,"Includes self-employed persons aged 15 years and over with or without an incorporated business and with or without paid help, as well as unpaid family workers."
159,"Occupation (based on the National Occupational Classification [NOC] 2021 Version 1.0) Occupation refers to the kind of work performed in a job, a job being all the tasks carried out by a particular worker to complete his or her duties. An occupation is a set of jobs that are sufficiently similar in work performed. Kind of work is described in terms of tasks, duties and responsibilities, often including factors such as materials processed or used, the industrial processes used, the equipment used, and the products or services provided. Occupations are generally homogeneous with respect to skill type and skill level. Occupation applies to the contribution of labour to that part of economic activity that is within the production boundary defined for the System of National Accounts."
,"Refers to the kind of work performed by persons aged 15 years and over as determined by their kind of work and the description of the main activities in their job. The occupation data are produced according to the variant of the National Occupational Classification (NOC) 2021 Version 1.0 for Analysis by TEER (Training, Education, Experience and Responsibility) categories."
,"Persons aged 15 years and over who never worked for pay or self-employment, or last worked for pay or self-employment prior to 2020 are included in this total."
160,"Includes persons aged 15 years and over who have worked at some point in time between January 2020 and May 2021."
161,"Management occupations refer to occupations with management responsibilities, including legislators, senior managers and middle managers."
162,"Professional occupations require completion of a university degree (bachelor's, master's or doctorate); or previous experience and expertise in subject matter knowledge from a related occupation found in TEER 2 (when applicable)."

164,"Occupations in TEER 3 usually require completion of a postsecondary education program of less than two years at community college, institute of technology or CEGEP; or completion of an apprenticeship training program of less than two years; or more than six months of on-the-job training, training courses or specific work experience with some secondary school education; or several years of experience in a related occupation from TEER 4 (when applicable)."
165,"Occupations in TEER 4 usually require completion of secondary school; or several weeks of on-the-job training with some secondary school education; or experience in a related occupation from TEER 5 (when applicable)."
166,"Occupations in TEER 5 usually require short work demonstration and no formal educational requirements."
167,"Refers to the kind of work performed by persons aged 15 years and over as determined by their kind of work and the description of the main activities in their job. The occupation data are produced according to the National Occupational Classification [NOC] 2021 version 1.0."
168,"Refers to the general nature of the business carried out in the establishment where the person worked. The industry data are produced according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Canada 2017 Version 3.0."
