Notes:
1,"""Gender"" refers to an individual's personal and social identity as a man, woman or non-binary person (a person who is not exclusively a man or a woman)."
,"Gender includes the following concepts:"
,"* gender identity, which refers to the gender that a person feels internally and individually;"
,"* gender expression, which refers to the way a person presents their gender, regardless of their gender identity, through body language, aesthetic choices or accessories (e.g., clothes, hairstyle and makeup), which may have traditionally been associated with a specific gender."
,"A person's gender may differ from their sex at birth, and from what is indicated on their current identification or legal documents such as their birth certificate, passport or driver's licence. A person's gender may change over time."
,"Some people may not identify with a specific gender."
,"Given that the non-binary population is small, data aggregation to a two-category gender variable is sometimes necessary to protect the confidentiality of responses provided. In these cases, individuals in the category ""non-binary persons"" are distributed into the other two gender categories and are denoted by the ""+"" symbol."
2,"This category includes men (and/or boys), as well as some non-binary persons."
3,"This category includes women (and/or girls), as well as some non-binary persons."
11,"Total income - The sum of certain incomes (in cash and, in some circumstances, in kind) of the statistical unit during a specified reference period. The components used to calculate total income vary between:"
,"* statistical units of social statistical programs such as persons, private households, census families and economic families;"
,"* statistical units of business statistical programs such as enterprises, companies, establishments and locations;"
,"* statistical units of farm statistical programs such as farm operator and farm family."
,"In the context of persons, total income refers to receipts from certain sources, before income taxes and deductions, during a specified reference period."
,"In the context of census families, total income refers to receipts from certain sources of all of its family members, before income taxes and deductions, during a specified reference period."
,"In the context of economic families, total income refers to receipts from certain sources of all of its family members, before income taxes and deductions, during a specified reference period."
,"In the context of households, total income refers to receipts from certain sources of all household members, before income taxes and deductions, during a specified reference period."
,"The monetary receipts included are those that tend to be of a regular and recurring nature. Receipts that are included as income are:"
,"* employment income from wages, salaries, tips, commissions and net income from self-employment (for both unincorporated farm and non-farm activities);"
,"* income from investment sources, such as dividends and interest on bonds, accounts, guaranteed investment certificates (GICs) and mutual funds;"
,"* income from employer and personal pension sources, such as private pensions and payments from annuities and registered retirement income funds (RRIFs);"
,"* other regular cash income, such as child support payments received, spousal support payments (alimony) received and scholarships;"
,"* income from government sources, such as social assistance, child benefits, Employment Insurance benefits, Old Age Security benefits, COVID-19 benefits and Canada Pension Plan and Québec Pension Plan benefits and disability income."
,"Receipts excluded from this income definition are:"
,"* one-time receipts, such as lottery winnings, gambling winnings, cash inheritances, lump-sum insurance settlements and tax-free savings account (TFSA) or registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) withdrawals;"
,"* capital gains because they are not by their nature regular and recurring. It is further assumed that they are more relevant to the concept of wealth than the concept of income;"
,"* employers' contributions to registered pension plans, Canada Pension Plan, Québec Pension Plan and Employment Insurance;"
,"* voluntary inter-household transfers, imputed rent, goods and services produced for barter and goods produced for own consumption."

32,"This measure combines both the Market Basket Measure (MBM) and the Northern Market Basket Measure (MBM-N). The MBM is applicable only in the provinces, excluding reserves. The MBM-N is applicable only in the territories, excluding reserves."
,"For the 2021 Census, the reference period for poverty data is the calendar year 2020."
,"The Market Basket Measure (MBM) refers to Canada's official measure of poverty based on the cost of a specific basket of goods and services representing a modest, basic standard of living developed by Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). The MBM thresholds represent the costs of specified qualities and quantities of food, clothing, shelter, transportation and other necessities for a reference family of two adults and two children. The square root of economic family size is the equivalence scale used to adjust the MBM thresholds for other family sizes. This adjustment for different family sizes reflects the fact that an economic family's needs increase, but at a decreasing rate, as the number of members increases."
,"The MBM basket (2018-base) is priced for 53 different geographic areas - 19 specific communities and 34 population centre size and province combinations. The MBM recognises the potential differences in the cost of the basket between similar-sized communities in different provinces and between different geographical regions within provinces. These thresholds are presented in Table 2.2 Market Basket Measure (MBM) thresholds for economic families and persons not in economic families, 2020, Dictionary, Census of Population, 2021."
,"The income measure used to compare against the MBM thresholds is the disposable income for the MBM. When the disposable income for the MBM of an economic family or a person not in economic family falls below the threshold applicable to the family or the person, the person or every member in the case of an economic family is considered to be in poverty according to MBM."
,"The Northern Market Basket Measure (MBM-N), developed by Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) and Statistics Canada in partnership with territorial governments and national Indigenous organizations, refers to the measure of low income based on the cost of a specific basket of goods and services representing a modest, basic standard of living in the territories. The threshold represents the costs of specified qualities and quantities of food, clothing, transportation, shelter and other expenses for the reference family of the MBM-N. For Yukon and the Northwest Territories, the reference family composes two adults and two children. For Nunavut, the reference family consists of five people (two adults and three children). The square root of economic family size is the equivalence scale used to adjust the Northern MBM thresholds for other family sizes."
,"For some families in Nunavut, the threshold includes an additional component called the inuusiqattiarniq component. This additional component is only applied to those families that have at least one person with Indigenous identity. The Northern MBM data for Nunavut reflects the methodology as described in the discussion paper 'Construction of a Northern Market Basket Measure of poverty for Nunavut' released on June 21, 2023."
,"The Northern MBM recognizes potential differences in the cost of the basket between different geographical regions across the territories. Hence, the 2018-base Northern MBM basket is priced for 13 different geographic areas."
33,"Poverty rate - The proportion or percentage of units whose income falls below a specified poverty line."
34,"Low-income status - The income situation of the statistical unit in relation to a specific low-income line in a reference year. Statistical units with income that is below the low-income line are considered to be in low income."
,"For the 2021 Census, the reference period for income data is the calendar year 2020, unless otherwise specified."
,"Prior to the 2021 Census, the LIM thresholds and the LIM low income statistics were derived and reported for the population residing outside of the territories and off reserve only. It was based on the consideration that the income, prices and expenditure patterns could be quite different in the territories and on reserve, and thus, could make the interpretation of the LIM low-income statistics difficult."
,"Since the 2016 Census, there were research studies that analyzed the feasibility of defining LIM thresholds that include the population living in the territories and on reserve, and examined the aspects that should be considered when interpreting low-income statistics based on this definition. With the guidance and support of such research, the 2021 Census expanded the coverage of the LIM concept to all regions in Canada, making it the only low-income concept that is applicable to the population living in the territories and on reserve."
,"Low-income measure, after tax (LIM-AT) - The Low-income measure, after tax, refers to a fixed percentage (50%) of median-adjusted after-tax income of private households. The household after-tax income is adjusted by an equivalence scale to take economies of scale into account. This adjustment for different household sizes reflects the fact that a household's needs increase, but at a decreasing rate, as the number of members increases."
,"Using data from the 2021 Census of Population, the line applicable to a household is defined as half the Canadian median of the adjusted household after-tax income multiplied by the square root of household size. The median is determined based on all persons in private households where low-income concepts are applicable. Thresholds for specific household sizes are presented in Table 2.4 Low-income measures thresholds (LIM-AT and LIM-BT) for private households of Canada, 2020, Dictionary, Census of Population, 2021."
,"When the unadjusted after-tax income of household pertaining to a person falls below the threshold applicable to the person based on household size, the person is considered to be in low income according to LIM-AT. Since the LIM-AT threshold and household income are unique within each household, low-income status based on LIM-AT can also be reported for households."
,"Prevalence of low income - The proportion or percentage of units whose income falls below a specified low-income line."
